            <h2>777 Days</h2>
            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>777 days ago, I didn’t know how much my life was changed since you came into my life. I didn’t know
                    that one person could quietly rewrite the way I see the world, the way I see myself, and the way I
                    understand love. I can now see so much colours in life that i couldn't before you. But you made me
                    do that. Slowly. Gently. Without even trying.</p>

                <p>You didn’t just become someone I love. You became someone who made me better without ever asking me
                    to be someone else. You helped me grow into a version of myself I can actually be proud of. Not
                    perfect, not finished, but stronger, calmer, more honest, more alive. That didn’t come from
                    motivation or pressure. It came from feeling loved in a way that made me want to rise and become a
                    better person that you deserve. I'm still not even near that person that you deserve and that's why
                    I'm trying to improve myself in many ways.</p>

                <p>Being with you has taught me that love is not loud promises or dramatic moments. It is choosing each
                    other on ordinary days. It is staying when things are messy. It is understanding each other even
                    when we don’t fully understand ourselves. Somehow, with you, even the hard parts feel safer. And
                    even im not the one to truly understand and speak the emotional language i still try to be there for
                    you in every ways i can.</p>

                <p>I feel incredibly lucky that out of all the people in this world, it was your soul that found mine.
                    Your kindness, your warmth, your way of caring, your little ways of being you. Loving you feels
                    natural, like breathing. It doesn’t feel forced or heavy. It feels like home. Where i can be ME
                    MYSELF without worrying about the world and i don't give a shit what the world says. Because I'm
                    really really hap[y that its you.</p>

                <p>777 days together is not just a number. It is hundreds of mornings, nights, conversations, laughs,
                    silences, and moments that built something real. And the truth is, this is the biggest jackpot of my
                    life. Not because it is perfect, but because it is us.</p>

                <p>I don’t just want to love you in this lifetime. I want to love this same beautiful soul in every
                    lifetime. In every version of the universe where we exist, I hope we keep finding each other. I hope
                    it is always you.</p>

                <p>I loved it when i saw that we hit 777 days together so it almost felt like a jackpot like I've won a
                    lottery so i felt like it has to be celebrated in some ways. Because why celebrate on some days when
                    love is always there. So everyday with you feels like a celebration to me. And I'm also sorry that i
                    telling you this when the day is almost over. But still i love you sooo much from all of my heart my
                    soul my everything.</p>

                <p>Thank you for being you.<br>
                    Thank you for loving me.<br>
                    Thank you for being these 777 days with me.</p>

                <p>And I’m still here.<br>
                    Still choosing you.<br>
                    Every day.<br>
                    Every night.</p>
